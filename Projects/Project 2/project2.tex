\paragraph{\large Overview}~\\~\\
You will investigate various aspects of turbulence using data from the MATERHORN field campaign conducted at Dugway Proving Ground. Information on the campaign can be found at: \href{http://www3.nd.edu/~dynamics/materhorn/}{http://www3.nd.edu/~dynamics/materhorn/}. Additional project resources are posted on Canvas and the \href{http://gibbs.science/efd}{course website}. Each group should obtain the sonic anemometer/thermometer data directly from me. The purpose of this project is to understand the physics of turbulent flow occurring at the measurement site. You will need to come up with a general scientific objective and hypothesis that you intend to test, present on, and write-up. For example, a group may choose as an objective: ``To better understand the effect of atmospheric stability on turbulence for a canyon outflow'' and a hypothesis that might be tested could be: ``Night-time turbulence is enhanced by the formation of surface level jet.''You must first select a time period for analysis. You may select the entire day for simple statistics and tethered balloon analysis, but you will want to focus on a shorter time period for the turbulence analysis that is required and outlined below. You may work in groups of two or three. Please select a project topic as soon as possible and obtain my approval. 

Oral presentations: \textbf{Monday, May 1 from 10:30a-12:30p}. Final report due: \textbf{Monday, May 1 at 5:00p}.

\paragraph{\large Assignment}~\\~\\Using the Sonic Anemometer data, please perform the following analysis:
\vspace{-10pt}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Simple Time Averaging:} calculate (a) 30-minute averages of $u$, $v$, $w$, and $T$, as well as (b) $\overline{ws}$, $\overline{wd}$, $\sigma_u$, $\sigma_v$, $\sigma_w$, $\overline{w^\prime T_s^\prime}$, $u_*$, $H_s$, $tke$, $L$, and $w_*$ (if appropriate), where $\overline{ws}$ and $\overline{wd}$ are average wind speed and direction, respectively. Describe the stability during the analyzed period.
	\item \textbf{Probability Distributions:} For a representative 30-minute averaging period, generate a CDF and PDF for $u$, $v$, $w$, and $T$ and report the skewness and kurtosis.
	\item \textbf{Autocorrelation:} Calculate the autocorrelation of at least one 30-minute period. What does this indicate?
	\item \textbf{Dissipation: } Using Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis, calculate the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy for several 30-minute periods. Calculate the Kolmogorov length scale.
	\item \textbf{Turbulence Spectra:} For at least one 30-minute averaging period, calculate the following turbulent energy spectra: $S_{uu}$, $S_{vv}$, $S_{ww}$, $S_{TT}$, as well as the following cospectra: $S_{uw}$, $S_{vw}$, $S_{wt}$. What do these spectra indicate about the analyzed boundary layer? Is there an inertial subrange?
\end{enumerate}
