# EFD
This repository contains course materials from Environmental Fluid Dynamics. 

EFD is an advanced special topics graduate course taught at the University of Utah in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Students are generally from atmospheric sciences or engineering. The course was originally developed by Dr. Eric Pardyjak.
 
These materials were adapted from Dr. Pardyjak's written notes and were expanded and updated for new content by me. I last taught the course using these materials in Spring 2017.
